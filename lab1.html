    <p>One of my favorite quotes is by Russian geologist Vladamir Verdnasky. In describing life and the biosphere as simply a large circular exchange of 
      chemicals and matter, he stated,</p>
      <blockquote>"Living matter is a specific kind of rock...an ancient, and at the same time, an eternally young rock. The purpose of animals and their 
        movement is to assist the winds and waves, to stir the brewing biosphere."</blockquote>
