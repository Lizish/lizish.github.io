      <h2 class="header">About me: </h2>

        <p> I am a student in <b>Environmental Science</b> and <b>GIS</b> at <a href="www.msudenver.edu"> MSU Denver </a>.
          I worked for <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/">CIRES</a> the (Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences)
          during the summer 2020 and 2021 breaks. In 2020, I worked for a team that studied geologic impacts on long timescale
          climate change. In 2021, I worked with evolutionary biologists and geophysicists to study microbehaviors in response
          to changes in Earth's geomagnetic fields caused by solar storms and flares. Both projects involved GIS Mapping
          and learning exciting new aspects of science!

   <div id="Quote" class="container">

    <p>One of my favorite quotes is by Russian geologist Vladamir Verdnasky. In describing life and the biosphere as simply a large circular exchange of
      chemicals and matter, he stated,</p>
      <blockquote><em>"Living matter is a specific kind of rock...an ancient, and at the same time, an eternally young rock. The purpose of animals and their
        movement is to assist the winds and waves, to stir the brewing biosphere."</em></blockquote>
